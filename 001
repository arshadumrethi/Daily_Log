Was Trying to convert Word jumble game to a web app with flask. 
This task is harder than i thought and flask is not as easy as it seems from the outside.
Its pretty confusing if you're not sure what you're doing. 
I posted a question to the flask subreddit, hopefully someone can help me. I'm not sure where to begin with this honestly. 

It might just be easier to build the app with JS rather than figure out flask. Flask is good for forms but not so good with static pages.
